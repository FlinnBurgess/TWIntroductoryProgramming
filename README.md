Solutions for the ThoughtWorks introductory programming exercises. 

The program can be run by compiling the java files in src and running the main method contained in Solutions.class with the relevant argument.

Valid arguments for running the program are as follows:
- triangle
- diamond
- fizzbuzz
- primefactors [integer]


## Feedback 
1. Wouldn't it be easier _for the user_ if you asked them to type in what they wanted in the console, 
instead of having to provide the arguments upfront?

2. I left various comments in your code, have a look at them.

3. Usually it's good practice to separate pieces of logic in methods that explain _what_ you're 
doing and _why_ by expressing that in their name.

3. Although I didn't expect tests at this Intro programmes, it would be interesting to see some at least
for the prime numbers problem, where the solution isn't yours per se. 

4. Good method separation and naming generally.

5. TIP: If you use IntelliJ it will allow you to see and improve on code parts that can be better. 
Alt+Enter / Option+Enter shortcut is your life savior in IntelliJ. This should come in handy when
improving code, imports, access levels, refactoring.
